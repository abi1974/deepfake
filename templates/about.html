<h1> DEEP FAKE DETECTION</h1>
</header>
<div class="container">
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Introduction:

In recent years, the proliferation of deepfake technology has raised significant concerns regarding the authenticity and integrity of digital media. Deepfakes, powered by advanced machine learning algorithms, enable the manipulation of audiovisual content to produce highly convincing fake videos and audios, often indistinguishable from genuine recordings. The potential for deepfakes to mislead, manipulate, and deceive poses serious threats to various aspects of society, including politics, journalism, and personal relationships.

To address these challenges, the Deepfake Detection Project employs state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to develop robust and effective tools for detecting and mitigating the spread of deepfake content. LSTM networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), excel at capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data, making them well-suited for analyzing the temporal dynamics present in audio and video sequences.

By leveraging the capabilities of LSTM networks, our project aims to achieve several key objectives:
